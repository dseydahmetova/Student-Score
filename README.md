- Code the <App> App component to display a <Student> component for each student object in the students array being held in state.
- Code the <Student> component so that it:
- Renders the student's name & bio properties
- Renders a <Score> component for each score object in the student's scores property.
- Code the <Score> component so that it renders the score object's date & score properties.
 

# KEEP IN MIND

You will not update state, just initialize it in App.js, passing it as props and rendering it's data in the components
